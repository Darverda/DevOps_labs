## Best Practices for Dockerfile

### Use a non-root user: 
Create a non-root user in the Dockerfile and run the container as that user. This helps minimize the potential impact of security vulnerabilities.

### Use specific COPY commands: 
Instead of using a wildcard (.) in the COPY command, specify the specific files that need to be copied. This ensures that only necessary files are included in the image.

### Layer sanity: 
Optimize the Dockerfile by grouping related instructions together to minimize the number of layers created.
Use a .dockerignore file: Create a .dockerignore file to exclude unnecessary files and directories from being added to the Docker build context and the final image.

### Use a precise version of the base image and language:
Specify a precise version of the base image and language to ensure consistency and avoid potential vulnerabilities.
