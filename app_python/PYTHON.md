# Flask seems like a good framework for my Python web application, based on the search results. Here's why Flask was the best option

**Lightweight and Minimalistic:** The Flask web framework offers all the capabilities and tools needed to create online applications in a lightweight and minimalistic manner. Because it doesn't require complex boilerplate code or enforce an inflexible framework, it is accessible to novice developers.

**Flexibility:** Flask gives developers greater control over the components and structure of their applications. It uses a micro-framework methodology, which implies that it has a compact core and facilitates simple extension with extra libraries and packages in accordance with project needs.

## Best Practices Applied in the Web Application

**Coding Standards:** The web application follows coding standards to ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability of the code. These standards include adhering to the PEP 8 style guide for Python code, which promotes clean and consistent coding practices.

**Modularity and Organization:** The code is well-organized and modular, following best practices for structuring a Flask application. The main application code is contained in a single file (app.py), making it easier to understand and maintain.

**Separation of Concerns:** The application separates the presentation layer (HTML) from the Python code using Flask's template rendering. This separation allows for better code organization and maintainability.

**Code Readability:** The code is written with readability in mind, using meaningful variable and function names. This improves code comprehension and makes it easier for other developers to understand and work with the code.

**Testing:** The application has been tested to ensure that the displayed time updates upon page refreshing. While the specific testing approach is not mentioned in the provided code, it is important to implement unit tests or integration tests to verify the functionality of the application.

**Code Quality:** Following coding standards, modular organization, and code readability practices contribute to maintaining code quality. Pylint was used, code has been rated at 10/10
